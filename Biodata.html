<center><h2><p style="color:white;">PERSONALITY</p></h2></center>
      <center><h3><p style="background-color:white">High Emotional Control</p></h3>
      <p style="background-color:white;">Emotional intelligence plays a huge role in many aspects at work. 
        Management and leadership roles will also involve a lot of communication, motivating people, and allocating tasks, all of which would be improved with 
        greater EQ levels. That being said, high levels of EQ will have a positive impact on any role. At work, I am able to communicating with 
        coworkers, supervisors, stakeholders, and potential customers. This leaves a lot of room for interactions where emotions are involved, and emotional 
        intelligence can be the difference-maker in these interactions being positive. Tied in with positive interactions, emotional intelligence opens up 
        opportunities to make strong connections. Understanding others and coming out of interactions with a more positive attitude can really increase 
        my chances of making meaningful connections. This is great for networking, general interactions at work and also great for my personal life. 
        Once I have a strong understanding of my own emotions and how to read and adjust the emotions of others, I be in a position to motivate other people at work. 
        I can help coworkers become more productive and be their best selves.  </p></center>

<center><h3><p style="background-color:white;">Extraversion</p></h3></center>
      <center><p style="background-color:white;">Extraversion is a broad personality trait that encompasses a number of more specific characteristics such as 
            sociability, assertiveness, high activity level, positive emotions, and impulsivity. The nature of the trait and its defining characteristics have 
            changed considerably over time, and a number of different mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the trait. These mechanisms include individual 
            differences in conditionability, arousal level, and sensitivity to rewarding stimuli. Modern extraversion research focuses on understanding the 
            characteristic patterns of feelings and behaviors associated with extraversion, and linking these patterns to specific psychophysiological mechanisms.

          <br>
<center><h3><p style="background-color:white;">Concientiosness</p></h3></center>
<center><p style="background-color:white;">Conscientiousness can be an indicator of success. The prime reason for this is that conscientious people need 
            to achieve their goals to feel fulfilled. Because of this, they are well organised and dependable, and they persevere until they meet these goals. 
            A person who scores high in conscientiousness on a personality test is better suited to do a job than someone who does not value this personality 
            trait.</p></center>
